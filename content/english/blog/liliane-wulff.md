title: RAT supports conference participation at the Annual Psychonomic Society Meeting in New Orleans
---

This year, we are thrilled to announce the second round of our annual travel grant for the first time. We are happy to support [Liliane Wulff's](http://psycho3.uni-mannheim.de/Personen/Liliane%20Wullf,%20M.Sc./) participation at the [Annual Psychonomic Society Meeting](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2018annualmeeting) in New Orleans. Liliane Wulff is a doctoral candidate at the GESS and her research focuses on multi-nomial modeling of cognition and associated age differences in the perception of older adults. She will present her paper "Unpacking Source Monitoring: What Mouse Movements Reveal About the Underlying Cognitive" (co-authored with Sophie Scharf).

We wish Liliane Wulff for her talk and her research all the best!
