title: Program your (first) Shiny App and gain insights into the board of RAM? Support us!
---

<!--![](/images/blog/ram-shiny.png)-->


## What is it about?

The Rationale Altruisten Mannheim financially support young scientists at the Faculty of Science of the University of Mannheim, e.g. with travel expenses for conference trips or with the financing of incentives for studies. Through our work we have already supported a large number of research trips, conference participations and studies worldwide! We'd love to showcase that interactively - preferably with a Shiny app (an interactive web app) that we can embed in our new homepage.

**And for this, we are looking for you!**

You've always wanted to apply your programming skills to build a web application?
Or you've always wanted to try your hand at it? Then you've come to the right place!

## What do we offer?

- Voluntary work for an innovative association that promotes young talents at the University of Mannheim
- The necessary know-how to support you with your programming skills
- Development of a Shiny-App, which will be integrated and used on our website
- Experience with project work
- And also unique insights into the work of the board of RAM

## What should you bring with you?

- Desire and motivation to try your hand at design and to program an aesthetic
- Shiny app
- Fun in learning new technology
- First programming experience (or experience with R) is great, but definitely not a must
- Time in the next 2-3 months (preferably) to design the Shiny app. We'll give you free reign on how you spend your time - you're also welcome to work in a team to gain valuable experience together.
- Student or PhD candidate at the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim

We are looking forward to meeting you!
