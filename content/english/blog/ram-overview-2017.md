Dear Rational Altruists,

Here comes a résumé about what happened in 2017 and what you can expect from 2018:

## What happened in 2017?

- We funded a language class in advanced Russian as part of the preparation for a field study (Anna-Lena Hönig, CDSS, Political Science).
- The Rationale Altruisten Travel Grant supported the conference participation of Felix Henninger (CDSS, Psychology) in Vancouver.
- We also supported the DataFest Germany 2017 in Mannheim.
- We awarded three prizes for best theses this year: one Otto-Selz-Award for the best MA-thesis in Psychology (Anna Kaiser), one Otto-Selz-Award for the best BA-thesis in Psychology  (Vera Eymann), and one RAM-Award for the best MA-thesis in Political Science (Emmy Lindstam).
- Besides, we updated the webiste, the logo, and the flyer.

## What can you expect in 2018?

*RAM-Awards also for Bachelor theses in Political Science and Sociology:* While the awards for MA-theses as well as the Otto-Selz-Award are already well established, we plan to also introduce awards for outstanding Bachelor theses in Political Science and Sociology.

*2018 kick-off event:* The event is going to take place in the Kombüse (Jungbuschstraße 23) on January 12, 2018 at 6 pm. Please let us know no later than a week in advance if you can make it so that we can reserve places appropriately.

We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
