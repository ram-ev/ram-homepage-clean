title: RAM supports funding for a language course as preparation for field research
---

We are pleased to financially support [Anna-Lena Hönig's](http://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/lspol4/?page_id=2517) participation in an intensive Russian language course at the State Language Institute at the Ruhr University in Bochum.
Anna-Lena Hönig is a doctoral candidate in political science at the CDSS/GESS of the University of Mannheim and is doing her doctoral thesis on the relationship between cooperation and resistance intensity.
In preparation for her field research in Kazakhstan, she will attend the advanced intensive language course.

We wish her good luck with the language course and the PhD project!
