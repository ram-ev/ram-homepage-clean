title: New names for RAM awards
---

As discussed at our annual meeting last December, we are planning to rename the RAM Awards in Political Science and Sociology to resemble their similarity (and equality) with the Otto-Selz-Prize. Therefore, we are looking for names of important (former) sociologists and political scientists with connections to the University of Mannheim. To get the best names possible, we count on you and particularly encourage you to nominate female names for the RAM awards!

Here is the link to our survey (until March 15, 2021).
