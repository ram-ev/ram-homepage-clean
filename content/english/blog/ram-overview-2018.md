Dear Rational Altruists,

Here comes a résumé of what happened in 2018:

## What happened in 2018?

- We funded the conference participation of Belinda Merkle in Bochum and supported WUMAN (a newly founded network for scientists at the University of Mannheim) both financially at their kickoff and idealistically.
- For the first time, we also offered the Rationale Altruisten Travel Grant two times this year. Our first RAT Grant supported the conference participation of Sebastian Juhl (CDSS, Political Science) in Vienna. The second RAT Grant provided financial support for Liliane Wullf’s conference participation in New Orleans (CDSS, Psychology). 
- We awarded five prizes for best theses this year: two Otto-Selz-Awards for the best BA-theses in Psychology (Miriam Neißner and Julian Quevedo-Pütter), and one RAM-Award for the best MA-thesis in Political Science (Hana Attia). For the first time, we also awarded two RAM-Awards for the best BA-thesis in Political Science (Lara Depenbrock) and Sociology (Jonas Stein).
- To overcome the lack of Stata licenses at the faculty, we held a prize draw for four half-year student licenses in Stata. The lucky winners are Mary Digiser, Berit Haupt, Anneli Maria Janzer, and Joshua Krüger.
- Besides, we updated the website and all our communication is now both in German and English.

## What else?

*Travel grants and awards:* We plan to continue with our newly introduced second RAT Grant and the RAM-Awards for BA theses in Political Science and Sociology.

*2019 kick-off event:* The (breakfast) event is going to take place in café Mie House (J7, 3) on February 9, 2019 at 10 am. If you are generally interested in coming to the kick-off event, please let us know no later than a week in advance if you can make it so that we can reserve places appropriately.

*Membership categories:* We would also like to use the chance to highlight our three different membership categories: students (€12/year), regular members (€36/year) and special members (€48/year). As we rely exclusively on membership fees to realize our funding projects, we would highly appreciate if you let us know about any change in your membership category.

We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
