title: RAM joins forces with Dataquest
---

We are excited to announce that [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) supports our [coding projects](https://www.ram-ev.de/en/blog/ram-shiny/) by giving us access to Dataquest’s learning environment. With Dataquest’s diverse learning paths (from R, Python, SQL to bash), you get the data experience you need as you learn — and the best part about it is that you start directly coding while going through illustrative instructions and explanations. We wish our project groups all the very best.
