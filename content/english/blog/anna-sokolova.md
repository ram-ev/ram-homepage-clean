title: RAM supports further education of Anna Sokolova
---

We are happy to support Anna Sokolova's participation in a course on experimental programming facilitated by the University of Oxford. She will use the acquired knowledge throughout her Ph.D. thesis to program and conduct behavioral experiments. We wish Anna for her research all the best!

> RAM's support allowed me to gain skills necessary for my doctoral dissertation: how to design, program, and run a behavioral experiment in a Python package oTree. I hope to spread the knowledge about the use of behavioral experiments in social sciences so that other students can benefit as well from this generous initiative. (Anna Sokolova)
