We are excited to announce the winners of the RAM-Award 2018 and the Otto-Selz-Prize 2018! The Otto-Selz-Prize honors Miriam Neißner and Julian Quevedo-Pütter for the best Bachelor theses in Psychology. The prize is funded by RAM. **Miriam Neißner** analyzed the effect of social exclusion on goals in performance situations while **Julian Quevedo-Pütter** critically investigated whether sleep supports the memory.

For the first time, we are happy to award this year the RAM-Award also for Bachelor theses in Sociology and Political Science. **Jonas Stein** receives the RAM-Award 2018 for the best BA thesis in Sociology. He studied what determines if a student enrolls in a MA program after finishing the BA. **Lara Depenbrock**’s BA thesis on the relationship between drug cultivation and political violence is awarded the RAM-Award in Political Science. Last but not least, **Hana Attia** receives the RAM-Award for her MA thesis in Political Science on the impact of the United Nations Security Council's memberships on US responses concerning human rights violations and democratic condemnations by this country.

We are highly thankful for the numerous outstanding nominations and look forward to delving again into various interesting topics next year!
