Dear Rational Altruists,

Here comes a résumé of what happened in 2019:

## What happened in 2019?

- We funded five projects this year: the conference presentations of Verena Kunz (EPSA, Belfast) as well as of Florian Andersen and Pavel Dimitrov Chachev (Conference of the Deutsche Nachwuchsgesellschaft für Politik- und Sozialwissenschaft e.V., Hannover); Emmy Lindstam’s data acquisition for her PhD project; financial support for incentives for respondents for Sophia Peter’s Bachelor thesis and Sabrina Berres’s PhD project.
- We also continued to offer a bi-annual Rationale Altruisten Travel Grant. Our first RAT Grant supported the conference participation of Laura-Ashley Fraunfelter (CDSS, Psychology) in Würzburg. The second RAT Grant provided financial support for Tobias Rettig’s conference participation in Zagreb (CDSS, Sociology). We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer from the field of Psychology for his invaluable input and help during the decision-making process for the RAT grants.
- We further awarded seven prizes for best theses this year: two Otto-Selz-Awards for the best MA-theses in Psychology (Christine Emmer and Aline Lanzrath), one Otto-Selz-Award for the best BA-thesis in Psychology (Melanie Alsmeyer), one RAM-Award for the best MA-thesis in Political Science (Viktoriia Semenova) and Sociology (Jascha Dräger). We further awarded two RAM-Awards for the best BA-thesis in Political Science (Gelila Enbaye) and Sociology (Daniela Wolf). This year’s selection was facilitated by a selection committee, consisting of Alexander Haberling, Dennis Hammerschmidt, Verena Kunz, and Alexander Staudt. We would like to thank the committee for their invaluable help and support!
- To address a broader audience, we also launched our own Instagram account this year.
- If you haven't already seen it... we are proud to present our very first advent calendar this year! If you’re as excited as we are, feel free to follow us on facebook, twitter, and Instagram.

## What else?

*Travel grants and awards:* We plan to continue with our second RAT Grant and the RAM-Awards for BA theses in Political Science and Sociology.

*Membership categories:* We would also like to use the chance to highlight our three different membership categories - students (€12/year), regular members (€36/year) and special members (€48/year). As we rely exclusively on membership fees to realize our funding projects, we would highly appreciate if you let us know about any change in your membership category.

*2020 kick-off event:* To kick off the new year, we will again organize a breakfast event. It is going to take place on February 15, 2020, at 10 am. The location (in Mannheim) will be determined and you will be updated shortly. This event will also be our general meeting where we determine again our annual accounts auditors. We will send a separate invitation to this event (including the agenda). If you are generally interested in coming to the kick-off event, please let us know no later than a week in advance if you can make it so that we can reserve places appropriately. We are looking very much forward to seeing you there!

*20 year anniversary:* RAM is turning 20 next year! We are already planning a small festivity and will update you shortly.

We wish you a wonderful advent season, merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
