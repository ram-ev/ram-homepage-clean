title: RAT supports conference participation at EMHFC 2019 in Würzburg
---

We are happy to announce that we will support [Laura-Ashley Fraunfelter's](http://klips.psychologie.uni-mannheim.de/english/Team/Laura-Ashley%20Fraunfelter/) participation at the annual [European Meeting on Human Fear Conditioning (EMHFC)](https://emhfc.blogs.uni-hamburg.de/events/emhfc-2019-wurzburg/) in Würzburg (May 6-8, 2019). Laura-Ashley Fraunfelter is a doctoral candidate at the GESS and the Otto-Selz-Institute. Her research domain includes Biological and Clinical Psychology as well as Psychotherapy. She will present her research on „Crossmodal extinction of conditioned fear responses”.

This year, we received an overwhelming number of excellent applications, and were only able to award one travel grant due to budget constraints — we would therefore like to thank all applicants for sharing their inspiring research and wish Laura-Ashley Fraunfelter all the best!
