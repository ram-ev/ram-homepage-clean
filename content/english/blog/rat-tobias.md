title: RAT supports conference participation at ESRA 2019 in Zagreb
---

This year, we are excited to announce again a Rationale Altruisten Travel Grant - we received an overwhelming number of excellent applications! We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for his invaluable input and help during the decision-making process.

We are happy to support [Tobias Rettig's](https://reforms.uni-mannheim.de/ionas/sowi/reforms/internet_panel/Team/rettig_tobias/) participation at the [European Survey Research Association (ESRA) Konferenz](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conferences/overview) conference in Zagreb. Tobias Rettig is a doctoral candidate and his research centers on survey methodology, measurement error, and response style bias. He will present his papers "Investigating Respondentsâ€™ Ability to Recall Previous Responses to Different Types of Questions in a Probability-Based Online Panel" and "How Much Text Is Too Much? Assessing Respondent Attention to Instruction Texts Depending on Text Length".

We wish Tobias Rettig for his talks and his research all the best!
