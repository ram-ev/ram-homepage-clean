title: Hans Albert and Franz Urban Pappi are the name givers for the RAM Awards in Political Science and Sociology!
---

Hans Albert is the name giver of the RAM Award in Sociology, Franz Urban Pappi is the name giver for the RAM Award in Political Science. We are proud to name our RAM Awards after them as both researchers had a significant impact on their academic disciplines and the development at the University of Mannheim. With this, they are excellent representatives to honor the intellectual curiosity and eagerness of our students.

[Hans Albert](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/newsroom/presse/pressemitteilungen/2021/februar/hans-albert-wird-100/) was Chair of Sociology and Theory of Science (1963-1989) and is a central figure of critical rationalism – a scientific thinking that shapes Mannheim’s unique profile until today.

[Franz Urban Pappi](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/de/profiles/franz-pappi) was Chair of Political Science I (1990-2007), and his research has a significant impact on empirical electoral research – a corner pillar in Mannheim’s Political Science portfolio.  


We would like to thank all those who supported us in finding the best name givers for both disciplines! We would not have been able to select these names without you. 

We are excited to announce the calls for applications for the Hans-Albert-Prize in Sociology and the Franz-Urban-Pappi-Prize in Political Science for the first time this year!

We will release more information on the CfA soon.
