There are no Stata licenses for students anymore? RAM e.V. got you covered! We hold a prize draw for 4 half-year licenses (Stata IC) among all students of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim!

What do you have to do to get one of these licenses?

## It’s really simple:

- You need to be a student at the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim
- And then choose between two options:

  - Either you like our facebook page and link a friend of the School of Social Sciences until 16.12.2018.
  - Or you send us an e-mail using your university e-mail address and state your name until 16.12.2018.
  - It does not matter which option you choose. Both groups are put in one pot and you have an equal probability to be drawn. Each participant can only participate once.

- You agree with our ‘Hinweisen gemäß Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO)’ by sending us an e-mail or participating via facebook. This implies that we are allowed to use your data for the lottery (i.e. your name, facebook contact details, e-mail address, and – if you win – your bank account details). We will use this data to determine the lucky winners, contact you, and pay you the prize money. If you win the prize, we will mention your name on our social media channels (facebook and twitter) as well as on our homepage. We also reserve the right to contact you via e-mail for membership promotion.
- The winners will be drawn randomly and we will contact them via e-mail or facebook. We will transfer you the money for a half-year student license (Stata IC) after you have sent us the invoice.

**We wish you all the best for your exam period and good luck!**
