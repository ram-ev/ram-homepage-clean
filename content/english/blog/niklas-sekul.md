title: RAM supports Master thesis on 'Will Our Society Continue to Fear the Infection With the Corona Virus Throughout the Pandemic?'
---

We are pleased to financially support Niklas Sekul's Master thesis with financial support for study participants. He conducts his thesis at the Chair of Clinical and Biological Psychology and Psychotherapy under the supervision of M.Sc. Psych. Kristina M. Hengen and M.Sc. Psych. Laura-Ashley Fraunfelter. His work deals with how the society continues to emotionally experience the pandemic, and an investigation on the scale needed for psychological prevention measures.

We wish him all the best for his research!
