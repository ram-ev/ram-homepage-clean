title: RAT supports conference participation at EPSA 2018 in Vienna
---

We are happy to announce that we will support [Sebastian Juhl's](http://www.sebastianjuhl.com/) participation at the annual conference of the [European Political Science Association (EPSA) 2018](http://www.epsanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EPSA-2018-academic-program-draft3.pdf) in Vienna (June 21-23, 2018). Sebastian Juhl is a doctoral candidate at the GESS and his research focuses on comparative politics and quantitative methods, especially spatial econometrics and Bayesian statistics. He will present his paper "W(ho Knows)? A Bayesian Approach to Network Uncertainty".

This year, we received an overwhelming number of excellent applications, and were only able to award one travel grant due to budget constraints — we would therefore like to thank all applicants for sharing their inspiring research and wish Sebastian Juhl all the best!
