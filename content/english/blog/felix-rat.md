title: RAT supports conference participation at EPSA 2020 in Prague
---

We are happy to announce that we will support [Felix Olsowski's](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/carey/team/academic-staff/olsowski-felix/) participation at the annual [European Political Science Association (EPSA) 2020](https://www.epsanet.org/) in Prague (June 18-20, 2020). Felix Olsowski is a doctoral candidate at the GESS and the University of Mannheim. He will present his research on "The Dark Side of Judicial Independence: Extrajudicial Killings as Alternative to Compliant Judges?". The map shows first results of Felix's research: The appointments of new judges (orange) since the beginning of the Duterte presidency.
 This year, we received again an overwhelming number of excellent applications, and were only able to award one travel grant due to budget constraints â€” we would, therefore, like to thank all applicants for sharing their inspiring research and wish Felix all the best!
