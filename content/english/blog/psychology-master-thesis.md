title: RAM supports research project in Psychology
---

Gernand, Franziska Leipold, and Roberto Scatorchia's project on the influence of cognitive load on the truth effect as part of their MA studies. We wish Alicia, Franziska, and Roberto for their research all the best!

> Thanks to the funding by the RAM we were able to conduct a study that we otherwise would not have had the financial capacities for.
This enabled us to follow our own research idea within a limited time and thereby gain valuable insights into research processes. Awesome! (Alicia Gernand, Franziska Leipold, and Roberto Scatorchia)
