The **Rationale Altruisten Mannheim e.V.** was founded in 2000 as part of a
student initiative. Our goal was and still is the support of young scholars of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim.

The association provides financial support to young scholars funded only via membership fees. It further offers a networking space between students and alumni to further future academic prospects.
