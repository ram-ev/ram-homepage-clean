RAM e.V. has been awarding prizes for the best theses at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim since **2010**. **There is currently no CfA.**

<!-- The current announcements are here:

- [**Franz-Urban-Pappi-Prize** for the best **Bachelor and Master Thesis in Political Science**]()
- [**Hans-Albert-Prize** for the best **Bachelor- and Master Thesis in Sociology**]()
- [**Otto-Selz-Prize** for the best **Bachelor- and Master Thesis in Psychology**](/files/Call_OttoSelzPrize-2021.pdf)
-->

<!-- Since 2010, we award the RAM award for one excellent **MA thesis in Sociology and in Political Science**, each worth € 150. As of 2018, we are happy to also honor the **best BA thesis in Sociology and Political Science** with € 100 each. For more information on how to apply for the **Hans-Albert-Prize** in Sociology and the **Franz-Urban-Pappi-Prize** in Political Science, please see [here](/files/RAM_Call_2021_Bachelor.pdf) and [here](/files/RAM_Call_2021_Master.pdf). Besides, we also honor the best theses in Psychology with the [**Otto-Selz-Prize**](/files/Ausschreibung_OttoSelzPrizee-2021.pdf). The prize carries a value of € 150 for master’s theses and € 100 for bachelor’s theses. -->

<br /> &nbsp;

## Submit your final thesis (BA and MA thesis)

The following documents are required for submission as **one ZIP** file:

1. [Complete form](/files/RAM_form_submission.pdf)
2. Anonymized thesis
3. Expert opinion of the supervisor (for the submission of the Otto Selz Award this has to be submitted **anonymized** in the form of an expert opinion or justification by the supervisor; for the submission of the Franz Urban Pappi Award and the Hans Albert Award the **anonymized** expert opinion has to be submitted if available)

Please save your submission as **one ZIP** file and name it as follows: `AWARD-NAME_LEVEL_YOUR-NAME.zip`. So if you apply for the Franz-Urban-Pappi-Prize with your master thesis, the name would look like this: `Franz-Urban-Pappi_Master_Mustermann-Max.zip`.

<!-- > Attention: Submissions for the Otto Selz Award can only be submitted via the supervisor. Unfortunately, no self-nominations can be accepted here.-->

### FAQ

You can find a detailed description in the short explainer video and the FAQ.

{{< youtube cASBIr3aaiQ >}}

<br /> &nbsp;


{{< detail-tag " Why do I have to anonymize my work when I have to put my name in the file name and in the form?" >}}
*The work will be reviewed by a jury of experts. Since the jury members are mainly members of the University of Mannheim, it is possible that some submitters will be recognized. In order to prevent personal relationships from influencing the evaluation, the jury members only receive the anonymized work. Only we as the board know which work belongs to which person, so that we can then award the prize ;-)*
<br /> &nbsp;
{{< /detail-tag >}}

{{< detail-tag "How do I anonymize a work correctly?" >}}
*In `Preview`, for example, the file is often not anonymized correctly. Therefore, the following approaches are better to submit a truly anonymized paper:*

1) *Remove names in the original document (Word, LaTeX) and save as PDF,*
2) *Use Adobe,*
3) *"print" file as PDF in any case (saving does not help, you can move the black bars)* **or**
4) *print, blacken and rescan ;-)*
<br /> &nbsp;
{{< /detail-tag >}}

{{< detail-tag "How does the selection process work?" >}}
*Just watch our video for that!*

*Alternatively, here is all the info in a nutshell:*

1. *you submit your anonymized work to us (incl. the form and the expert opinion).*
2. *a professional jury (usually consisting of professors, post-docs and PhD students) reviews all papers and determines the winner.*
3. *we will inform everyone who submitted their work about the outcome of the award :-)*
<br /> &nbsp;
