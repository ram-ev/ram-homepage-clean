The purpose of **Rationale Altruisten Mannheim e.V.** is to support young scholars of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim.

In particular, we fund final theses and other academic projects with the desire to advance students’ academic and professional goals.

Owing to the generous support of our members, we are able to assist various theses and dissertations as well as participation at conferences and training programs. Up to date, we were able to fund the majority of applications with a substantial amount of financial support.

<!--For a detailed list of all funded students, see here or in the map below.
